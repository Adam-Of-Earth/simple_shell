# Project 0x15 - Simple Shell

Welcome to the repository for the **HAASH**, or **H**olberton, **A**dam, & **A**lex **Sh**ell.
This is the final project for the first trimester of the Holberton New Haven curriculum, working in C to assemble our own simple shell, replicating the methodologies by which the original **sh** shell operates, but without the memory leaks that may come in tow.


## Getting Started

Pull the latest version of the MASTER branch, and compile all ***.c*** and ***.h*** files to assemble the HAASH!
### Prerequisites

```
Ubuntu LTS v14.04
GCC installed on terminal.
Basic understanding of C/UNIX-based shells.
```

### Installing

1. Pull "master" branch from currernt repository.
```
git pull master https://github.com/ajdebiase/simple_shell
```

2. Compile all C and header files in the root directory.
```
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -o haash
```

3. Run the output file locally to enter into our custom simple shell.
```
$ ./haash
```

4. Enjoy using the HAASH!
```
$ echo "hello, world!"
```
